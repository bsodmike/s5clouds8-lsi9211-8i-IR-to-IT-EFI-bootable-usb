## Creating USB Flash drive

The following 'spec' has been confirmed to work

- Sony 4GB USB2.0 Flash Drive.  I have been _told_ that USB3 sticks may not work.

Format as follows, use `lsblk -f` and `fdisk -l` to locate the correct device and replace `/dev/sdX` below

- Wipe the drive with `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=16k status=progress`
- `fdisk /dev/sdX`
  - Select `o` to create new empty DOS partition table.
  - `n` and choose to create a primary partition, where the last sector is `+500M`.
  - `w` to write and exit
- `fdisk /dev/sdX1` + `a` to set the primary partition as bootable (active). Choose `w` to write and exit.
- `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1` to format as FAT16.

### Preparing the drive

Mount and copy the contents of the `usb` folder to the root of the USB drive.  Here's a breakdown of where these files have been obtained from 

- `/efi/boot/bootX64.efi` - This is [Shell_Full.efi](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/UDK2010.SR1/EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/X64/Shell_Full.efi) from the Tianocore Github repo; the X64 full-shell from the `UDK2010.SR1` branch.  It's _the oldest_ and I needed to find a version old enough that would work with `sas2flash.efi`.  Refer [details by `boris_d` and the dreaded _"InitShellApp: Application not started from Shell"_ error when using a newer version of the Tianocore shell.](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/how-to-flash-lsi-9211-8i-using-efi-shell.50902/)

- `sas2flash.efi`: from `9211-8i_Package_P20_IR_IT_Firmware_BIOS_for_MSDOS_Windows.zip` 
- `2118it.bin`: from `Installer_P20_for_UEFI.zip` ([link](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/12350820))
- `mptsas2.rom`: from `Installer_P20_for_UEFI.zip` ([link](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/12350530))

The zip files mentioned above are included in the root of this repo for archival purposes.

### Disabling Secure Boot (in Asus UEFI)

In the `Boot` tab, scroll down to `Secure Boot` and choose 'Other OS' as the selection.  You will need to save and reboot to ensure this persists.  This same view will let you verify that keys are _unloaded_.

You do not need to wipe your Secure Boot keys; if you do, make sure to make a backup first.

### Booting the drive (in Asus UEFI)

In Asus UEFI,  going to `Exit > Launch EFI Shell from USB devices` would not work (for me, YMMV); instead it would keep presenting a warning regarding Secure Boot.

Instead, head to the `Boot` tab in the UEFI and locate a bootable entry starting with `UEFI: ....` that matches the capacity of your media.  In my case, this was a Sony USB drive.

Since Secure Boot was already disabled, this booted into the EFI shell straight away.

## Flashing the LSI HBA Card to IT-mode

- Erase controller flash memory: `sas2flash.efi -o -e 6` DO NOT REBOOT!!

- Write new firmware and BIOS to card: `sas2flash.efi -o -f 2118it.bin -b mptsas2.rom.`
- Make sure to verify before rebooting: `sas2flash.efi -listall`

Reboot and hit `Ctrl-C` to verify the new firmware in IT mode has persisted.

## Hardware Used (as a baseline)

- AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X
- Asus Zenith Extreme X399 (TR4) w/ Noctual NH-U14S-TR4-SP3 Cooler
- G.Skill DDR4 32GB RAM @ 3200MT/s
- Fedora 27 / 4.15.14-300.fc27.x86_64
- Samsung 850 Pro 250GB SSD


## Level1Tech's Thread

This repo is a result of [posting my findings in a thread](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/asus-uefi-friendly-efi-usb-no-luck-flashing-lsi9211-8i-hba-from-ir-to-it/126344/6) on the Level1Tech's forum.  Feel free to share your findings there.

Much thanks to [Whizdumb](https://forum.level1techs.com/u/Whizdumb) for pointing me in the right direction with crucial info about using USB2 drives.
